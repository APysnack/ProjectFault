<h2>The Gist</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. <strong>These Terms include a mandatory arbitration provision in Section 16.

<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the products and services we provide through or for <a href="https://projectfault.com">ProjectFault</a> (collectively, “Services”).</p>
<p>These Terms also govern visitors’ access to and use of any websites that use our Services. Please note though that the operators of those websites may also have their own separate terms of use.</p>
<p>Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services, and this Agreement will apply to any changes.</p>
<h2>1. Who’s Who</h2>

If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using using our Services you&#8217;re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.</p>
<p>Please see below to determine which entity your Agreement is with, which depends on where you reside and which Services you use. We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and all countries located in Europe (including the UK and ROI).</p>
<h2>2. Your Account</h2>
<p>When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response.</p>
<p>We may limit your access to our Services until we’re able to verify your account information, like your email address.</p>
<p>When you create an account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., website updates). Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested, you can opt out of these communications.</p>
<p>You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions. If you get fired because of a blog post you write about your boss, that’s on you.</p>
<p>Don’t share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it.</p>

</ul>
<h2>10. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update, change, or discontinue any aspect of our Services at any time. Since we’re constantly updating our Services, we sometimes have to change the legal terms under which they’re offered. The Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of ProjectFault, or if ProjectFault posts a revised version. We’ll let you know when there are changes: we’ll post them here and update the “Last Updated” date, and we may also post on one of our blogs or send you an email or other communication before the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services after the new terms take effect will be subject to the new terms, so if you disagree with the changes in the new terms, you should stop using our Services.</p>
<h2>11. Termination</h2>
<p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any the Agreement or any ProjectFault policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason.</p>
<p>You may stop using our Services at any time.</p>
<h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
<p class="important">Our Services are provided “as is.” ProjectFault and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither ProjectFault, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.</p>
<h2>13. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.</h2>
<p class="important">Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of Maryland, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services that are not otherwise subject to arbitration (as indicated below) will be the state and federal courts located in Baltimore City County, Maryland.</p>
<h2>14. Arbitration Agreement</h2>
<p class="important">Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Baltimore, Maryland, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>
<h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p class="important">In no event will ProjectFault, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to ProjectFault under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. ProjectFault shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ProjectFault, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services, Content that you post, or other ProjectFault-related activities conducted through your or another user’s website.</p>
<h2>17. US Economic Sanctions</h2>
<p>You may not use the Services if such use is inconsistent with U.S. sanctions law or if you are on any list maintained by a U.S. government authority relating to designated, restricted or prohibited persons.</p>
<h2>18. Translation</h2>
<p>These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</p>
<h2>19. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between ProjectFault and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.</p>
<p>Project Fault may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.</p>
<h2>20. Media Usage</h2>
<p>Any content not related to programming (Exclusively: Audio, Video, Written materials, Images, and any lyrics, jokes contained within them) collectively referred to as "media" on ProjectFault that fall under the category of intellectual property of ProjectFault or Alan Pysnack may be used or replicated only by registered users of ProjectFault for any purposes except those indicated under "Media Exceptions". Users must be registered to ProjectFault at the time of this use or replication for this privilege to apply. By using or replicating any form of media, the registered user acknowledges that they understand that this is not a transfer of intellectual property, but rather permission to use this media for their own purposes, and that the registered user is directly responsible for ensuring that their usage does not fall under any of the exceptions. If the registered user has any uncertainty regarding whether or not a usage falls under an exception, they must first contact us using our <a href="{{ url_for('ancillary.contact') }}">Contact Form</a> with thorough details about their usage and get approval from a ProjectFault administrator before using that media.</h2></p>
<h3>Media Exceptions:</h3>
<p>The following uses of media are considered "exceptions" and these uses of ProjectFault media are strictly prohibited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any usage that is considered offensive or harmful, as determined by us in our sole discretion. This includes but is not limited to uses that are related to violence, hate speech, or any illegal activities.</li>
<li>Any usage that is considered profiteering, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any profit made off ProjectFault media that exceeds $5,000 is subject to review. This includes projects that are any combination of media, regardless of the media type (For example: A "mixtape" or "album" that includes 2 or more songs or a Video that contains a song. These are all to be considered one "usage" of media). For gt By using this media, the registered user acknowledges that the moment their use of ProjectFault media exceeds a profit of $5,000, it is their responsibility to contact and negotiate an agreement to divvy all future profits in a way that is is directly proportional to the amount of profits that were generated by the contribution of ProjectFault's intellectual property in reaching a profit of $5,000. This proportion is to be determined by us in our sole discretion. ProjectFault publicly acknowledges that in the case that a media usage exceeds $5,000, the first $5,000 of profit belongs to the registered user, and cannot be retroactively collected from the user.</li>
<li>Any usage of media that was created with a 3rd party and/or would violate any form of intellectual property that does not belong to ProjectFault. This includes but is not limited to: vocals or lyrics from song collaborations that are not the intellectual property of ProjectFault, Instrumentals containing samples that are not the intellectual property of ProjectFault, songs using instrumentals created by others that are not the intellectual property of ProjectFault, or any brushes, fonts, icons, etc. that are not the intellectual property of ProjectFault. For any piece of media, it is the registered user's responsibility to reach out to and gain approval from all contributors to the media. However, if the user gains approval from all other contributors, they may use the media subject to all other tems listed under "20: Media".</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like to add one final note, which is not part of the "terms" listed above and is not admissable in a court of law. I'm a kind and reasonable person, it's not my goal to "trick" anyone. Don't use any of my content in a blatantly hateful or inappropriate way. You can use any jokes, lyrics, melodies, songs, I've written for almost any purpose, just don't make an enormous profit off anything of mine without throwing me a bone. You can use my songs, graphics, or videos freely but if it involves a collaboration with someone else you may also need their permission first before using it and I'm not legally liable if you neglect to do that. If you find something of mine that is a collaboration with someone else and want to use it, you can still use any parts of my content that do not belong to them.</p>
